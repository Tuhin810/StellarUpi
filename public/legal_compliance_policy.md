# StellarUpi (Ching Pay) | Compliance & Legal Policy (2026)

## 1. Statutory Compliance Overview
StellarUpi (operating as Ching Pay) resides in a highly regulated landscape as of 2026. Legally classified as a **Reporting Entity** under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), the platform operates as a **Virtual Digital Asset Service Provider (VDASP)**. All operations are governed by the "Compliance Trinity": Registration, Taxation, and Banking.

---

## 2. FIU-IND Registration (The Legal Gateway)
Pursuant to the guidelines issued in March 2023, every VDASP must maintain active registration with the **Financial Intelligence Unit - India (FIU-IND)**.

*   **PMLA Responsibility:** The platform is responsible for monitoring and preventing illegal fund movements.
*   **Mandatory Appointments:** We must appoint a **Principal Officer** and a **Designated Director** accountable for regulatory compliance.
*   **Transaction Reporting:** Automated filing of **Suspicious Transaction Reports (STRs)** is triggered by Raze AI or manual oversight for unusual patterns (e.g., individual transfers exceeding ₹10 Lakh).

---

## 3. Taxation Framework (30% + 1% Rule)
All INR ↔ Crypto and Crypto ↔ Crypto transactions are subject to Section 194S of the Income Tax Act.

### 3.1 TDS Automation (1%)
On every "Sell" or "Swap" transaction where a user receives INR or another asset, StellarUpi must:
*   Deduct **1% TDS** at the source.
*   Remit the deducted amount to the government.
*   Generate a **TDS Certificate** for the user.

### 3.2 Capital Gains Tax (30%)
*   Users are liable for a **30% Flat Tax** on net profits from VDA transactions.
*   **No Offsetting:** Losses in one trade cannot be offset against profits in another. Each trade is treated as an isolated taxable event.
*   The app provides a downloadable **Annual Tax Statement** to facilitate ITR filing.

---

## 4. Banking & Payment Architecture
While crypto-banking is legally permissible, operation requires strategic partnerships to navigate institutional caution.

*   **Direct On-Ramp:** Integration with licensed partners (e.g., Onramp.money, Transak) handles the primary KYC and INR-to-Token conversion.
*   **Virtual Accounts (Vanity IBANs):** Users are assigned unique virtual account numbers for IMPS/NEFT transfers to ensure seamless reconciliation.
*   **The "Gold Rule" Policy:** Crypto is viewed as an asset, not legal tender. Direct merchant payments via XLM are prohibited. The platform must automatically "Sell" user assets for INR internally to settle merchant UPI transactions in Rupees.

## 6. Internal Governance
