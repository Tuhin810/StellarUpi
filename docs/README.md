# 🚀 Introduction

Welcome to the official documentation for **StellarUpi** (formerly Ching Pay). 

**StellarUpi** is a next-generation Web3 payment ecosystem built on the **Stellar Blockchain**, designed to bring the ease and familiarity of India's **UPI (Unified Payments Interface)** to the world of decentralized finance.

## 🌟 Our Vision

The complexity of blockchain often acts as a barrier to mass adoption. Long hexadecimal addresses, gas fees, and complex wallet management scare away the average user. 

StellarUpi solves this by:
1.  **Humanizing Web3**: Mapping complex wallet addresses to simple IDs like `user@stellar`.
2.  **Familiar UX**: Providing a "Scan and Pay" experience identical to UPI.
3.  **Low Friction**: Leveraging Stellar's near-instant finality and negligible transaction costs.
4.  **Value-Added Services**: Integrating automated savings (Gullak), AI insights (Raze), and family spending controls.

## 🛠️ Key Pillars

### 1. The Stellar-UPI Bridge
We use the Stellar network as the settlement layer, enabling P2P transfers, path payments, and cross-border remittances with the speed of a local transaction.

### 2. Universal Access
Whether you are a crypto native with a hardware wallet or a new user with just a phone number, StellarUpi provides a seamless entry point via signature-based vaults and biometric authentication.

### 3. Integrated Economy
Beyond just payments, StellarUpi is a financial hub. From splitting bills in family groups to earning yield on automated savings, the entire economy is at your fingertips.
