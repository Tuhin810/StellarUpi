# 📉 Taxation & TDS (1% Rule)

Navigating Indian crypto taxes is one of the most stressful parts of owning digital assets. StellarUpi automates this entire process at the protocol level.

## 🧾 The 1% TDS (Section 194S)
As per Indian Income Tax laws, a 1% **Tax Deducted at Source (TDS)** must be deducted on the transfer of a Virtual Digital Asset.

### How we automate it:
Whenever you "Sell" XLM/USDC or perform an "Off-ramp" to INR:
1.  **Calculation**: The app calculates 1% of the transaction value.
2.  **Splitting**: The transaction is split into two parts:
    *   **99%**: Sent to your destination/bank account.
    *   **1%**: Sent to the StellarUpi Compliance Pool.
3.  **Remittance**: StellarUpi remits these funds to the IT Department on behalf of the user's mapped PAN number.

## 📊 Capital Gains Reporting (30% Tax)
India levies a flat **30% tax** on profits from crypto transfers, with no provision for setting off losses.

### Annual Tax Statements:
Inside your **Profile**, click on **"Download Tax Report"**:
*   **Cost Basis Tracking**: We track the INR value of every XLM/USDC you acquire.
*   **Profit Calculation**: We automatically calculate the profit on every sale or transfer to another wallet.
*   **Ready-to-File**: The generated PDF follows the format required for the **Schedule VDA** in the ITR-2/ITR-3 tax forms.

## 💎 Gullak Yield Taxation
*   **Interest Income**: The yield earned from your Gullak streaks is categorized as "Other Income".
*   **Exemption**: Small amounts of yield are generally exempt up to certain annual limits, but our reports include them for full transparency.
