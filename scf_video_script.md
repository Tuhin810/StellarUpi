**[Camera On You]**
"Hey everyone! I’m [Your Name], and I’m thrilled to show you **Ching**, our vision for building what we call the 'UPI for Crypto.'

Right now, Web3 is just too hard for the average person. We deal with seed phrases, gas fees, and public ledgers where everyone can see your balance. It’s intimidating. 

With Ching, we are combining the borderless power of the Stellar network with the extreme simplicity of India's UPI system. Let me show you how it works."

**[App Screen: Open to the Login Screen & PAN Verification]**
"First, let's talk about getting started. In Ching, there are no 12-word seed phrases to write down. 

*(Action: Type in your phone number and request OTP)*

You just enter your phone number. We send an SMS OTP. 

*(Action: Enter the OTP and log in. Briefly show the Security/Verification screen)*

And you're in! Under the hood, we abstract away all the complex Web3 account creation. For complete security and compliance, we've also integrated **PAN Verification** for our Indian users, ensuring a trusted environment while making onboarding fast and familiar."

**[App Screen: Tap the Add Money / Onramp section]**
"Getting crypto into the app is just as native. 

*(Action: Tap 'Add Money', wait for the Onramp overlay to appear)*

We've integrated a direct fiat Onramp, so users can buy XLM using their local currency right inside the app. No external exchanges needed."

**[App Screen: Move to Send Money & Universal QR Scanner]**
"Now, the core of the app: sending money. 

*(Action: Open the Send Money screen, show the QR scanner)*

With our **Universal QR** integration, you can scan any standard payment QR code. Whether it's another Stellar wallet or a compatible payment code, Ching seamlessly reads it and processes the payment directly from your Stellar balance. There's no need to memorize long addresses."

**[App Screen: Show Personal Chat & Request Money]**
"Payments are inherently social. That's why we built messaging directly into Ching.

*(Action: Open the Chat interface, select a friend, and send a message or payment request)*

You can chat personally with your friends through our secure interface, and even send a **Payment Request** right in the chat. They just tap 'Pay' and the transaction settles on Stellar in seconds."

**[App Screen: Show Send Money & ZK Privacy Toggle]**
*(Action: Go to send money again, and toggle the 'Incognito Mode' switch)*

"But what about privacy? If you toggle on our **Incognito Mode**, Ching uses Zero-Knowledge (ZK) proofs. You can send a transaction that settles instantly on the public Stellar network, but your financial details and history remain completely private."

**[App Screen: Show Schedule Payment, Group Payments & Splits]**
"We also wanted to bring real banking and advanced expense management on-chain. 

*(Action: Navigate to the Schedule Pay screen, then Group Page / Splits)*

Need to pay rent every month? Use our **Scheduled Payments** feature to set it and forget it. 

Went out for dinner with friends? Create a **Group Payment** or use our **Split Bill** feature to seamlessly divide expenses and settle them instantly in crypto."

**[Camera On You]**
"Why did we choose Stellar? Because to make 'UPI for crypto' a reality, we needed fractions-of-a-cent fees, sub-five-second finality, and the robust programmable logic that Soroban provides for our scheduled payments and ZK infrastructure. Stellar is simply the absolute best network built for real-world, everyday payments.

We are applying to the Stellar Community Fund to help us accelerate development and start bringing this seamless experience to the masses. 

Thank you so much for your time and your support. We’re incredibly excited to build the future of payments on Stellar with you!"
