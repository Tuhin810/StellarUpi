## 💎 The Flagship Innovations

Ching isn't just a wallet; it's a **next-generation financial operating system** built on Stellar. It bridges the gap between decentralized finance and the familiarity of Web2 payment systems like UPI.

### 1. Direct UPI Liquidation Bridge ⚡
The ultimate off-ramp experience. Scan **any standard UPI QR code** (at a grocery store, cafe, or online merchant), and Ching automatically converts your XLM to INR and executes a direct IMPS/UPI payout via our sandbox bridge. 
- **Zero friction**: Pay merchants in INR using your crypto balance.
- **Speed**: Settle in under 2 seconds.
- **Verification**: Instant "Liquidation Bridge Verified" receipts with RRN (Reference Numbers).

### 2. Gullak 2.0: Streak-Based Yield Engine 🌿
A revolutionary micro-savings vault inspired by the traditional Indian "Gullak" (piggy bank).
- **Chillar Round-Ups**: Automatically rounds up your ₹142 coffee to ₹150, sending the ₹8 "Chillar" to your vault.
- **Tiered APR**: Your interest rate grows as you save consistently.
  - 🟠 **Starter (0-4 Days)**: 3.6% APR
  - 🔵 **Saver (5-14 Days)**: 11% APR
  - 🟣 **Pro Saver (15+ Days)**: 18% APR
- **Protocol Yield**: Daily growth applied directly to your vault balance.

### 3. Raze AI Assistant: Voice-to-Chain Intelligence 🤖
Powered by **Google Gemini 1.5 Flash**, Raze is your personal financial agent.
- **Contextual Actions**: Say "Send 50 XLM to Alice" or "How much do I owe the dinner group?" and Raze executes the tools.
- **AI Receipt Scanner**: Upload any physical bill; Raze itemizes it and populates your Split Expense drawer.
- **Insights**: Proactive spending analysis and budget alerts.

### 4. Sonic Pulse: Acoustic Identity Discovery 🔊
Exchange Stellar IDs with nearby devices using **ultrasonic frequency-shift keying (FSK)**.
- **No Internet Required** for peer discovery.
- **Secure**: High-frequency encoded audio (16kHz+) that replaces QR scanning for 1-on-1 transfers.
- **Instant**: Transmits `username@stellar` through air in seconds.

### 5. ZK-Identity & Incognito Mode 🛡️
Toggle **Incognito Mode** for complete payment privacy.
- **Groth16 ZK-SNARKs**: Generates simulated zero-knowledge proofs for identity and amount.
- **Private Settlements**: Transactions settle on Stellar but remain shielded from the public activity feed.
- **Protocol 25 Verification**: Uses cutting-edge hashing for identity commitments.
